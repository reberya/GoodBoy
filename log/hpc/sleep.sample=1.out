Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	sleep
	1

rule sleep:
    input: results/sample_1_copy.txt
    output: results/sample_1_sleep.txt
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: sample=1

Imagine that this is a job with more intensive resource requirements...
